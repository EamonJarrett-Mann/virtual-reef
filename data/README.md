# [Reef Check](https://reefcheck.org/)

Reef Check's mission is to empower people to save our reefs and oceans through education, research, and conservation.

## Who we are
Founded in 1996, the Reef Check Foundation exists to help preserve the oceans and reefs which are critical to our survival, yet are being destroyed. With headquarters in Los Angeles and volunteer teams in more than 90 countries and territories, Reef Check works to protect tropical coral reefs and California rocky reefs through education, research and conservation.

## What we do
Every year, Reef Check trains thousands of citizen scientist divers who volunteer to survey the health of coral reefs around the world, and rocky reef ecosystems along the entire coast of California. The results are used to improve the management of these critically important natural resources. Reef Check programs provide ecologically sound and economically sustainable solutions to save reefs, by creating partnerships among community volunteers, government agencies, businesses, universities and other nonprofits.

## Where we work
Reef Check has coordinators, teams, and EcoDiver training facilities in countries around the world. Since the first Reef Check coral reef monitoring survey in 1997, over 10,000 surveys have been completed by Reef Check EcoDivers in over 95 countries and territories. Join a team today!
