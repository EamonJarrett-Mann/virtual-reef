# Virtual Reef

## Goals
Reef Check needs a good way to generate visualizations based on the data from surveys.
The intended audience is people who may not be familiar with the underwater environment,
so granular precision isn't as important as giving an accurate impression of the environment
over time.

## Installation
1. Install [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Any 3.8 version should be fine.
2. Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). We use Anaconda for dependency management.
3. Run `conda env create -f environment.yml`. This will create the `virtualreef` environment.
4. Run `conda activate virtualreef`. This activates the conda environment for the project and you should be able to run the project.
